Raw Data,,,,
Relative Yield as the biomass of a plants in pairwise mixture with another scaled by its biomass in isolation,,,,
,,,,
,neighbors J,,,
targets i,T,D,F,P
T,1,0.38,0.73,0.65
D,0.84,1,0.78,0.79
F,0.56,0.38,1,0.61
P,0.66,0.53,0.68,1

Wins and Losses as binary,,,,
1 indicates that row species outcompetes column species, 0 indicates its loss,,,,

This looks like a perfectly transitive heirarchy - D-P-T-F,,,,
