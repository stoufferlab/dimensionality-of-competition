These are preliminary estimates of interaction coefficients between 10 native annual serpentine species from southern California.
Data were collected between 2007 and 2014.
Interaction coefficients are based on a population growth model for annual seedbanking species (see Levine & HRL 2009 for model).
Interaction coefficients define the amount that one germinant of species j reduces the seed production of species i.
Note - due to computational / statistical model fitting issues, the interaction coefficients (alphas) were constrained to be positive.

Parameter	Definition
species i	focal species i (that species j influences)
species j	competitor j
Parameter	paramater name in model
Mean		mean parameter value
SD		standard deviation of parameter (from MCMC draws)
