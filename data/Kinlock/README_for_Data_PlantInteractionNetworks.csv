Column name,DescriptionAuthors,Authors of publicationJournal,Journal in which study is publishedTitle,Title of publicationHabitat,"The habitat of the plant community being studied. Includes estuarine (estuary, salt marsh), deciduous forest, coniferous forest, plantation forest, tropical forest (evergreen rainforest, seasonal deciduous forest, tropical cloud forest, mangrove forest), chaparral, desert, grassland (hot summer cold winter; grasses and forbs; fire, grazing, and drought regimes), agricultural, old field, and urban habitats."Country,Country ISO codeLatitude,"In decimal degrees (-S, N)"Longitude,"In decimal degrees (-W, E)"SpeciesRichness,Number of species in studySpecies,"Species studied, in order (using The Plant List, http://www.theplantlist.org)"Families,"Families of each species, in order (using The Plant List)"WoodyHerbaceous,"Woody, herbaceous"PlantAge,"Juvenile individuals only, adult individuals only, or both"Invasive,"If all species are native, 0. If any are invasive, index of the invasive species (using same order as in 'Species' column). If multiple spp. are invasive, index of each spp. delimited by comma. Determining invasiveness: Invasive Species Compendium (http://www.cabi.org/isc/). Species were invasive in the country in which the study was conducted."C3C4,"If all species are C3, 0. If any are C4, index of the C4 species (using same order as in 'Species' column). If multiple spp. are C4, index of each spp. delimited by comma."Nfixing,"If all species are not N fixers, 0. If any are N fixers, index of the N fixing species (using same order as in 'Species' column). If multiple spp. are N fixers, index of each spp. delimited by comma."ExperimentClass,"Greenhouse; garden (entirely planted, e.g., plantations for trees); field (plantings or transplants are okay, e.g., planted/transplanted seedlings under adult)"TypeOfControl,"Did the study include a true control, in which the target plant was grown alone, or only a monoculture control?"Replicates,Number of replicates per species combinationDuration,Length of experiment in monthsPlantPerformanceMetric,"Total biomass, aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, change in biomass, RGR, etc."Units,Units for plant performance metricMeanPlantPerformance,Mean of all measures of plant performance in the studySEPlantPerformance,Standard error of the mean for all measures of plant performance in the studyDataSource,"Location data was extracted from, usually tables or figures in the manuscript, supplement, or appendices, sometimes supplied directly from author after a request"NetworkMonoCtrl,"Entire plant interaction network, composed of relative interaction indices (RII) between species. Interactions delimited by commas, read in by rows (effect of column species j on row species i). Species number ('SpeciesRichness') determines  matrix size. Species order is the same as with 'Species' column. NAs mean that no interaction occurs between the two species. RII calculated relative to monoculture."NetworkTrueCtrl,"Same as 'NetworkMonoCtrl' column, but with RII calculated relative to a true control (individuals growing alone)."
